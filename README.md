The geolocalisation.py file contains a python script which allows the user to geolocate sites in france based on their name and the name of French administrative divisions (Commune, departement, region) 
by inserting a .csv file which includes the sites names and their administrative division then exporting a .csv file that contains the columns for the longitude and latitude for each site.
